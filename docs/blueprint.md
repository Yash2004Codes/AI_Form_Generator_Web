- Submission Capture: Captures data entered by users in generated forms. This data can be text, numbers, selections, and/or file uploads.
- Form Submission Management: Stores form submissions, associating them with the appropriate form and user.
- File Upload Handling: Handles file uploads within forms, integrating with Cloudinary to store files and reference them in submissions.
